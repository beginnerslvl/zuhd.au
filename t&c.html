              <p class="faq-content">The Service is designed to provide customers with custom kanduras and related accessories (“items”) using fabrics hand selected by our personal stylists.

Upon completing your customizations, you are prompted to checkout and submit our payment in full. Thereafter, you will be prompted to select a method to input your body measurements. Options include: requesting a tailor visit, sending us one of your well-fitting kanduras, or entering your own measurements. Once your body measurements have been captured, Zuhd begins the process of producing your bespoke kandura. Upon completion, your kandura will be shipped to the designated shipping address listed in your online profile.</p>
